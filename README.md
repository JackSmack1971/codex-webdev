I've created a complete set of AGENTS.md files for modern web development technologies in 2025. Here's what I've provided:

## **Complete AGENTS.md File Collection:**

### 1. **Global Personal AGENTS.md** (`~/.codex/AGENTS.md`)
- Universal development philosophy for 2025
- Cross-project standards and preferences
- Security-first approach with AI-augmented development
- Technology stack recommendations based on current best practices

### 2. **Project Root AGENTS.md**
- Modern web application architecture guidelines
- React 18+ with TypeScript frontend setup
- Node.js backend with Express and TypeScript
- PostgreSQL + Redis database configuration
- Complete development workflow and project structure

### 3. **React + TypeScript AGENTS.md** (`frontend/AGENTS.md`)
- Component architecture with atomic design principles
- Advanced TypeScript patterns and configurations
- Redux Toolkit with RTK Query for state management
- Performance optimization with React.memo and code splitting
- Comprehensive testing strategies with React Testing Library
- Accessibility implementation following WCAG 2.2 standards

### 4. **Node.js + TypeScript Backend AGENTS.md** (`backend/AGENTS.md`)
- Express.js application with TypeScript strict mode
- Repository pattern with Prisma ORM
- JWT authentication with RS256 algorithm
- Comprehensive error handling and validation with Zod
- Docker containerization and production deployment
- Health checks and monitoring integration

### 5. **Database AGENTS.md**
- PostgreSQL advanced features and optimization
- MongoDB schema design and aggregation pipelines
- Redis caching patterns and pub/sub implementation
- Vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate) for AI applications
- Performance monitoring and security best practices
- Migration strategies and backup procedures

### 6. **DevOps and Security AGENTS.md**
- Modern CI/CD with GitHub Actions (avoiding legacy Jenkins)
- Kubernetes deployment with security hardening
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Comprehensive security scanning (SAST, DAST, container scanning)
- Monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, and structured logging
- Disaster recovery and backup strategies

## **Key 2025 Technologies Covered:**

✅ **Frontend**: React 18+, Vue.js 3+, Svelte, TypeScript strict mode  
✅ **Backend**: Node.js 20+, Express.js, Python FastAPI, Go, Rust  
✅ **Databases**: PostgreSQL 15+, MongoDB 7+, Redis 7+, Vector databases  
✅ **DevOps**: Kubernetes, Docker, GitHub Actions, Terraform  
✅ **Security**: DevSecOps, SAST/DAST scanning, container security  
✅ **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, structured logging  
✅ **AI Integration**: Vector databases, AI-powered development tools  
✅ **Performance**: Core Web Vitals optimization, edge computing  

## **Hierarchical Structure:**

The files are designed to work together hierarchically:
1. **Global** → Personal preferences across all projects
2. **Project Root** → Shared project guidelines and architecture
3. **Technology-Specific** → Detailed implementation for each technology stack

Each file includes practical code examples, security considerations, testing strategies, and deployment configurations that AI agents can follow to generate high-quality, modern code that meets 2025 industry standards.

You can place these files in your projects according to the hierarchical structure, and AI coding agents will use them to understand your architecture, follow your conventions, and generate code that aligns with modern best practices.
